# Creating a Datepicker

Using Typescript, design and develop a Datepicker that allows a user to type in a date in the MM/DD/YYYY format. 
In addition to this, the user should be able to click a button to display a popup that would allow them to search for and select a date. 
This should include the ability to indicate “blackout” dates and easily jump between months and years.
Do not use any third-party libraries directly relating to the form and or functionality of the Datepicker itself. 
Do not use any frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, etc…) to build the application. 
Do not use any date manipulation libraries like MomentJS or anything similar. Libraries like popper are allowed.
